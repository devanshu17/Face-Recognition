# Face-Recognition
Face Recognition implemented using OpenCV in python, and Haar Cascade classifier
The proces is divided into three scripts:
1) "DataSetCreater.py" is used to detect the faces, and make 20 jpg file in gray scale, as the datasets, for each face it detects.
2) "Trainer.py" is used to train the model
3) "Detect.py" is then usedd to recognize and label the faces.
